# Pig_Game
A game I made to practice Python using Tech with Tim's video.

The game is written in Python.
I made it myself using the video just for the idea.
In the game you have to throw a dice. When it is your turn, the dice is thrown and if it lands on 1 you lose all points you made that turn. However you can stop your turn whenever you want, collecting all the points you made.
